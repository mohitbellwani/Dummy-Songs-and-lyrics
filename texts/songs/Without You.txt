<H1 style="color:white"><center>Without You.<center></H1>

<p style="color:white;">I can't win, I can't reign<br>
I will never win this game<br>
Without you, without you<br>
I am lost, I am vain,<br>
I will never be the same<br>
Without you, without you<br>
I won't run, I won't fly<br>
I will never make it by<br>
Without you, without you<br>
I can't rest, I can't fight<br>
All I need is you and I,<br>
Without you, without you<br></p>

<div style="height:0px;background-color:powderblue;">
<p style="color:black;">Oh oh oh!<br>
You! You! You!<br>
Without...<br>
You! You! You!<br>
Without...you<br>
Can't erase, so I'll take blame<br>
But I can't accept that we're estranged<br>
Without you, without you<br>
I can't quit now, this can't be right<br>
I can't take one more sleepless night<br>
Without you, without you<br></p>

<div style="height:0px;background-color:powderblue;">
<p style="color:cyan;">I won't soar, I won't climb<br>
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed<br>
Without you, without you<br>
I can't look, I'm so blind<br>
I lost my heart, I lost my mind<br>
Without you, without you<br>
Oh oh oh!<br>
You! You! You!<br>
Without...<br>
You! You! You!<br>
Without...you<br>
I am lost, I am vain,<br>
I will never be the same<br>
Without you, without you<br>
Without...you<br>
